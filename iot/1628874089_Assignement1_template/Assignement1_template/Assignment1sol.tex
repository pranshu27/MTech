\paragraph{\large{Summary}} We've mentioned a few development boards here, but there are plenty of more possibilities that will best suit your product development needs.
IoT development has a very bright future. It contributes to the solution of everyday difficulties by developing a variety of goods. It is evident from the above table that a Raspberry Pi is a clear winner in most of the situations. However, other boards offer a strong competition in different areas as specified below:

\subparagraph{Raspberry Pi versus Arduino}\cite{ar, bb}
These two are the most popular boards among the researchers. The  detailed  
analysis  show  that  higher  end  development  boards  such  as  
Raspberry Pi-4 B+ have higher performance in comparison with 
other  boards  like  Arduino in  terms  of  its  
storage and computing speeds but at the cost of higher price. The places where we need to perform a task repeatedly, we can use Arduino where we use Raspberry Pi where we need to perform multiple tasks together. Also Arduino is used for simple tasks as compared to Pi which is used for highly complex work. Pi in general can be thought of as a mini computer in itself. The key distinction between the two is that Arduino tends to have a strong I/O capability which drives external hardware directly. Whereas Raspberry Pi has a weak I/O which requires transistors to drive the hardware.

\subparagraph{Espressif ESP8266}\cite{are} The ESP8266 has
exceptionally basic equipment foundational layout and is
most superb utilized in customer applications, for example,
information logging and control of actuators from online
worker applications. Being  a  low  cost  device, it  is  a  first  choice  for  implementing 
sensor networks in an IoT scenario. However, due to limited storage and computing capabilities, and inability to support popular OS like Linux, it is used in a fewer areas as compared to other boards. 

\subparagraph{Particle IO - Argon}\cite{compstudy} The Particle Argon is a significant IoT prototyping stage thinking about eliminated programming, straightforward code migration, and speedy progression of ventures. However, just like ESP8266, inability to support any other operating system is still a matter of concern here.

\subparagraph{Beaglebone Black} \cite{bbvr} It is apparent that Beaglebone is simply more versatile and compatible with makers and developers’ use. It is pretty well documented which allows users to have enough support and tutorials for projects and learning. One of the major drawbacks is, it is costlier than Pi, which a offers somewhat more features and is more commonly used.  If you’re looking for affordable, casual use and versatility, Raspberry Pi would be more suitable for you. But if you’re more into IoT applications and stability for industrial usage, this is the one. 

\subparagraph{Discovery STMP32MP157C} \cite{stmp, top21} These highly secure boards are specifically designed to accelerate 3D graphics in applications such as graphical user interfaces (GUI), menu displays or animations.There is a dedicated 3D graphics processing unit (GPU) and MIPI-DSI display interface and a CAN FD interface. The only drawback is its 148 whopping dollars price, which might not be justified over a much cheaper Raspberry Pi available in the market.

\textbf{\large{Following are the applications of various boards as discussed in the first question:}}
\section{Arduino UNO}
\subsection{Arduino Satellite (ArduSat)}
ArduSat is an open source satellite completely based on Arduino to create a stage for space
discoveries. Built by Spire previously known as NanoSatisfi, ArduSat collects various types of
information’s from the space environment, with the help of numerous sensors that includes
temperature sensors, pressure sensors, cameras, GPS, spectrometer, and magnetometer etc with its programmable Arduino processors.
This platform also allows common public to experiment their projects in space. ArduSat can be
used for photography from space, making a spectrograph of the sun, detecting high energy
radiation, compiling temperature readings and observing meteors etc. .

\subsection{ArduPilot (ArduPilotMega - APM)}
ArduPilot is an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) based on the open source platform and built using
Aruino Mega which is able to control independent multicopters, fixed-wing aircraft, traditional
helicopters and ground rovers. It was created by the DIY Drones community in 2007 and was also an award winning platform of 2012.

\section{ParticleIO  (ARGON)}

\subsection{Reduction in traffic noise}
This board can be easily used to collect data using sensors which will then be transferred over Particle cloud, and could be accessed easily from anywhere. One of the main issues with such an application could be a source for a power supply, as the setup needs to be deployed somewhere. The Argon takes care of this for you with its included charging circuitry, which makes it easier to connect a Li-Po battery.


\section{Espressif ESP8266}
\subsection{Implementation of Esp8266 in Home automation:}
Due to its compact size, wide availability, and low cost, this can be easily used in building simple to complex home automation projects. Its WiFi module is widely used in several autonomous as well as non-autonomous systems.

\subsection{Wearabale device}  
The ESP8266 board used was NodeMCU 1.0 (ESP-12E Module) with CPU Frequency: 80MHz and Flash Size: 4M (3M SPIFFS). the development of prototype that enables monitoring of heart rate and inter beat interval for several subjects

\section{Beaglebone Black}
\subsection{Efficient and self-controlled  surveillance  drone } Due to its networking  capabilities(it  is  capable  for  providing  all  sorts  of networking  services  like  FTP,  TELNET,  SSH  an), remote  control, multitasking capabilities(uses Linux), time  management(has NTP) and growing worldwide support, this board is an ideal choice for building such a drone.
